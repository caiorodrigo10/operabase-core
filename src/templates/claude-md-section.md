# Operabase

> Skills-first agent framework for Claude Code.
> Generated by `npx operabase init`. See [constitution.md](./constitution.md) for non-negotiable principles.

## Constitution

This project follows the Operabase Constitution with formal principles and automatic enforcement.

**Document:** `constitution.md` (project root)

Key principles:
- **Skills-First** — Intelligence lives in Skills (SKILL.md), not in runtime code.
- **Agent Authority** — Each agent operates within its declared scope. Only `@devops` can push.
- **Story-Driven Development** — All work starts from a story in `docs/stories/`.
- **Quality First** — Quality gates run automatically via hooks. No shortcuts.

## Installed Squads

<!-- OPERABASE:SQUADS:START — installer populates this section -->
| Squad | Agents | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| (populated by installer) | | |
<!-- OPERABASE:SQUADS:END -->

---

## Agent Activation

Use `@agent-name` to activate an agent. Each agent has a dedicated skill in `.claude/skills/{agent}/SKILL.md`.

<!-- OPERABASE:AGENTS:START — installer populates this section -->
| Agent | Persona | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| (populated by installer) | | |
<!-- OPERABASE:AGENTS:END -->

## Quality Gates

Quality gates enforce code standards automatically via Claude Code hooks.

### Pre-Commit Gates
Runs before every `git commit`:
```
npx operabase gates --stage pre_commit
```

### Pre-Push Gates
Runs before every `git push`:
```
npx operabase gates --stage pre_push
```

Gate commands are configured in `operabase.yaml` under the `gates` section. Squads can extend or override gates in `squads/{squad}/config/quality-gates.yaml`.
