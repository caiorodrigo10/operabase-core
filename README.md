# Operabase

Skills-first agent framework for Claude Code.

> Under development. Beta release coming soon.

## Overview

Operabase is a meta-framework that orchestrates AI agents as Claude Code Skills. It provides a light Node.js runtime for CLI commands, config validation, quality gates, and state management -- while all agent intelligence lives in prompt engineering (SKILL.md files).

## Quick Start

```bash
npx operabase init       # Interactive setup wizard
npx operabase validate   # Validate operabase.yaml
npx operabase status     # Show installed squads and version
```
